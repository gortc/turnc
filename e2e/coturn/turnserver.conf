# Uncomment to use long-term credential mechanism.
# By default no credentials mechanism is used (any user allowed).
#
lt-cred-mech

# This option is opposite to lt-cred-mech.
# (TURN Server with no-auth option allows anonymous access).
# If neither option is defined, and no users are defined,
# then no-auth is default. If at least one user is defined,
# in this file or in command line or in usersdb file, then
# lt-cred-mech is default.
#
#no-auth

# 'Static' user accounts for long term credentials mechanism, only.
# This option cannot be used with TURN REST API.
# 'Static' user accounts are NOT dynamically checked by the turnserver process,
# so that they can NOT be changed while the turnserver is running.
#
#user=username1:key1
#user=username2:key2
# OR:
#user=username1:password1
#user=username2:password2
#
# Keys must be generated by turnadmin utility. The key value depends
# on user name, realm, and password:
#
# Example:
# $ turnadmin -k -u ninefingers -r north.gov -p youhavetoberealistic
# Output: 0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee
# ('0x' in the beginning of the key is what differentiates the key from
# password. If it has 0x then it is a key, otherwise it is a password).
#
# The corresponding user account entry in the config file will be:
#
#user=ninefingers:0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee
# Or, equivalently, with open clear password (less secure):
#user=ninefingers:youhavetoberealistic
#

# Uncomment if extra security is desired,

# By default, the nonce value is unique for a session,

# Allowed OpenSSL cipher list for TLS/DTLS connections.

# CA file in OpenSSL format.
# Forces TURN server to verify the client SSL certificates.

# Example:
#CA-file=/etc/ssh/id_rsa.cert

# Curve name for EC ciphers, if supported by OpenSSL

# Flag to prevent stdout log messages.
# By default, all log messages are going to both stdout and to
# the configured log file. With this option everything will be
# going to the configured log only (unless the log file itself is stdout).
#
#no-stdout-log

# Option to set the log file name.
# By default, the turnserver tries to open a log file in
# /var/log, /var/tmp, /tmp and current directories directories
# (which open operation succeeds first that file will be used).
# With this option you can set the definite log file name.
# The special names are "stdout" and "-" - they will force everything
# to the stdout. Also, the "syslog" name will force everything to
# the system log (syslog).
# In the runtime, the logfile can be reset with the SIGHUP signal
# to the turnserver process.
